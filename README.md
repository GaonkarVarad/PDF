MOBILE PHONE DETECTOR
This mobile phone detector can sense the presence of an activated mobile phone from a distance of four to five meters. So it can come handy in examination hall or meetings where mobile phones are not permitted. The circuit can detect incoming and outgoing calls, SMSes, Internet and video transmissions even if a mobile phone is kept in silent mode. When it detects an RF signal from an activated mobile phone, itâ€™s LED starts blinking and continues to blink until the signal stops.
